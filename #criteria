## Admission Criteria for Entries

An entry qualifies if it meets at least one of these:

1. **Structural Insight** – Changes how you model or think about a subject.
2. **Decision Impact** – Affects real-world outcomes (money, projects, timing).
3. **Framework Creation** – Reusable tool, rule, or lens.
4. **Entropy Reduction** – Resolves confusion, compresses complexity.

> Entries must be reality-checked — no raw emotional spirals or hallucinations.

## INDEX.md Usage

- **Format:** `[ID] | Lane | Subject | Core Insight/Action | Status | Extra Tag`  
- **Lane:** Tactical / Conceptual  
- **Status:** Open / Stable / Active / Parked  
- **Extra Tag:** Optional, e.g., checkpoint date, reusable, impact  

**Rules:**
- Maximum **7 active entries** at a time (merge, archive, or downgrade if exceeded)  
- Most entries stay **one-line in INDEX.md**; expanded files only if necessary  
- Increment ID sequentially: SOD-001, SOD-002, SOD-003…

## Workflow

1. Qualify the thought (see Admission Criteria)  
2. Compress it into one line using the INDEX.md template  
3. Add it to INDEX.md  
4. Optional: create detailed file in Tactical/Conceptual if needed  
5. Commit and save

## Philosophy / Guiding Principles

- Slow, intentional, bounded (like a snail with a shell)  
- On deck — surfaced, ready, visible, but controlled  
- Prevent hallucinations — reality-checked, compressed insights only
