Version: 0.1  
Purpose: Prevent hallucinations.  
Design: Hybrid tactical + conceptual governance layer.

---

## Philosophy

SnailsOnDeck exists to:
- Surface only reality-checked insights
- Compress signal
- Prevent stream drift
- Maintain bounded active cognition (≤7 active entries)

Slow. Intentional. On deck — not everywhere.

## Repository Structure

SnailsOnDeck/
│
├─ Tactical/        # Real-world actions, checkpoints, execution
├─ Conceptual/      # Frameworks, schemas, reusable models
└─ INDEX.md         # One-line hybrid oversight table

Most entries live in INDEX.md.
Expanded files are optional.

## Admission Criteria

An entry qualifies if at least one is true:

1. Structural Insight — Changes a mental model
2. Decision Impact — Affects execution, money, timing
3. Framework Creation — Reusable tool or lens
4. Entropy Reduction — Compresses confusion into clarity

No raw spirals.
No transcripts.
Reality-checked only.

## Hard Cap Rule

Maximum 7 active entries total.
If adding an 8th:
- Merge
- Archive
- Or downgrade status

Bounded deck = stable system.

## Daily Add (Mnemonic: Q-CAF-C)

Q — Qualify  
C — Compress  
A — Add (INDEX.md)  
F — Flag (lane/status/tag)  
C — Cap check (≤7)

<30 seconds. No friction.
