**Author:** Kris Park  
**Status:** Active Development  
**Created:** January 2026  
**Purpose:** Healing AI — Preventing hallucination, misattribution, and fabrication in artificial intelligence systems.

---

## What This Is

`SnailsOnDeck` is a structured methodology and reference repository for identifying, documenting, and correcting hallucination in AI systems.

The name is intentional.

Snails are slow. Deliberate. Grounded. They do not race ahead of the facts. In a landscape where AI systems confidently fabricate — asserting that documented work was destroyed, that events never happened, that people said things they did not say — the antidote is not speed. It is precision.

This repository is the precision layer.

---

## The Problem

AI hallucination is not a minor inconvenience. For creators, it is an active threat:

- AI systems fabricate biographical facts about real people.
- AI systems misattribute creative work to incorrect authors.
- AI systems assert with confidence that documented materials no longer exist — while those materials are actively in use.
- AI systems reconstruct narratives from training data in ways that blur the line between a creator's real experience and AI-generated fiction.

These are not hypothetical risks. They are documented, lived experiences that this repository exists to address.

---

## The Approach

SnailsOnDeck operates as a **hybrid repository** — part structured documentation, part living methodology, part public record.

Its core principle: **bounded, verified, reusable thinking.**

Every entry is:
- Sourced (where did this come from?)
- Timestamped (when was this established?)
- Bounded (what does this claim, exactly, and what does it not claim?)
- Reusable (can this be used to correct a future instance of the same error?)

## Who This Is For

- **Creators** whose work, identity, or narrative has been misrepresented by an AI system.
- **Developers** building AI systems who want a documented case library of real hallucination patterns.
- **Legal professionals** establishing authorship records in cases where AI misattribution is a factor.
- **Researchers** studying the intersection of AI reliability and human creative rights.

## Relationship to KRISP/ARK

`SnailsOnDeck` is the companion project to **[krisp-arc](https://github.com/johansebastianbach444-lgtm/krisp-arc)**.

Where `krisp-arc` protects the **creator record** — the immutable ledger of who made what and when — `SnailsOnDeck` protects the **information ecosystem** around that record. It ensures that what is said about a creator, their work, and their history remains accurate, verifiable, and correctable.

Together they form a complete system:

```
krisp-arc          →    What you made is protected.
SnailsOnDeck       →    What is said about you is accountable.
```

## A Note on Intent

This is not a combative project. It is a constructive one.

AI hallucination is a frontier problem — one the industry has not yet solved. The goal of `SnailsOnDeck` is not to attack AI systems but to help them do better. To give them — and the humans who build and use them — a documented, honest record they can rely on.

Slow is smooth. Smooth is accurate. Accurate is everything.

Version: 0.1  
Purpose: Prevent hallucinations.  
Design: Hybrid tactical + conceptual governance layer.

---

## Philosophy

SnailsOnDeck exists to:
- Surface only reality-checked insights
- Compress signal
- Prevent stream drift
- Maintain bounded active cognition (≤7 active entries)

Slow. Intentional. On deck — not everywhere.

## Repository Structure

SnailsOnDeck/
│
├─ Tactical/        # Real-world actions, checkpoints, execution
├─ Conceptual/      # Frameworks, schemas, reusable models
└─ INDEX.md         # One-line hybrid oversight table

Most entries live in INDEX.md.
Expanded files are optional.

---

## Admission Criteria

An entry qualifies if at least one is true:

1. Structural Insight — Changes a mental model
2. Decision Impact — Affects execution, money, timing
3. Framework Creation — Reusable tool or lens
4. Entropy Reduction — Compresses confusion into clarity

No raw spirals.
No transcripts.
Reality-checked only.

## INDEX.md Format

[ID] | Lane | Subject | Core Insight/Action | Status | Extra Tag

Lane:
- Tactical
- Conceptual

Status:
- Open
- Active
- Stable
- Parked

Extra Tag (optional):
- Checkpoint
- Reusable
- Impact
- Draft

---

## Hard Cap Rule

Maximum 7 active entries total.
If adding an 8th:
- Merge
- Archive
- Or downgrade status

Bounded deck = stable system.

## Daily Add (Mnemonic: Q-CAF-C)

Q — Qualify  
C — Compress  
A — Add (INDEX.md)  
F — Flag (lane/status/tag)  
C — Cap check (≤7)

<30 seconds. No friction.
