> Tactical and Conceptual folders can hold optional expanded notes. Most entries stay in INDEX.md.

## Ready-Made Lane Names

- **Tactical / Operational** → Real-world moves, projects, checks  
- **Conceptual / Framework** → Reusable models, schemas, insights  
- **Optional Tags:** Checkpoint, Reusable, Impact, Draft  

---

## Admission Criteria for Entries

An entry qualifies if it meets at least one of these:

1. **Structural Insight** – Changes how you model or think about a subject  
2. **Decision Impact** – Affects real-world outcomes (money, project, timing)  
3. **Framework Creation** – Reusable tool, rule, or lens  
4. **Entropy Reduction** – Resolves confusion, compresses complexity  

> Must be reality-checked; no raw emotional spirals or hallucinations.

## INDEX.md Usage

- **Format:** `[ID] | Lane | Subject | Core Insight/Action | Status | Extra Tag`  
- **Lane:** Tactical / Conceptual  
- **Status:** Open / Stable / Active / Parked  
- **Extra Tag:** Optional, e.g., checkpoint date, reusable, impact  

**Rules:**
- Maximum **7 active entries** at a time (merge, archive, or downgrade if exceeded)  
- Most entries stay **one-line in INDEX.md**; expanded files only if necessary  
- Increment ID sequentially: SOD-001, SOD-002, SOD-003…
